I uploaded all my texts to a word-by-word markov chain to make an AI version of myself. 

Some of the funnier creations from my own messages include:
- ETA: febuary 
- Omegle for hash map
- I am at a message from the summer 
- Hurry we can get the goat cheese burger. Going to invade russia
- Resolved: Justice requires an hour

Obviously this repository does not contain the text file with all of my texts. If you want to see it work, add your own texts. See Jupyter notebook in "db stuff" folder.
